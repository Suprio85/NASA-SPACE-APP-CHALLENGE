### Explanation:
- **Backend Port (3000)**: This is mentioned under the "Ports" section to indicate that the backend will run on port 3000.
- **Frontend Port (5000)**: The frontend will run on port 5000, as mentioned in the same section.
- **npm run dev**: Users are instructed to use this command to run both frontend and backend simultaneously. You can configure the `dev` script to handle both processes, likely using something like `concurrently` in `package.json`.

This file serves as a basic guide for setting up, running, and understanding the project configuration. Let me know if you want me to further customize it!
